My project is called Scripts By Suhani, which is for my future calligraphy business. I wanted to use my web development skills on something I would actually need in the future. I used HTML, CSS, and JS.
I struggled with trying to add the items to the cart. I then, however,decided that I would further improve the functionality of my website before adding that feature. This is only a provisionary website I was making for practice. 
These images, besides my own, do not belong to me.
